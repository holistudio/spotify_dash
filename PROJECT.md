## Goals and Objectives

**Premise:** You're looking for music that reflects a certain kind of mood or vibe. Luckily, Spotify users have curated lots of playlists that group songs/tracks not just by particular artists or genres but other descriptive words. 

**End product:** A Tableau dashboard that visualizes relevant data regarding songs/tracks and artists that relate to certain moods/vibes (text descriptions) specified by the user.
